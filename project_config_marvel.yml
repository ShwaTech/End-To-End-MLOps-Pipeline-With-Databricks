# ðŸ”¹ Environment-specific configurations
# Define catalogs (Databricks Unity Catalog) and schemas for each environment (prd, acc, dev).
# This allows you to separate production, acceptance/testing, and development data.
prd:
  catalog_name: mlops_prd
  schema_name: marvel_characters
acc:
  catalog_name: mlops_acc
  schema_name: marvel_characters
dev:
  catalog_name: mlops_dev
  schema_name: marvel_characters

# ðŸ”¹ MLflow experiment locations
# Define where to log model runs in Databricks MLflow.
# The "basic" experiment might be for simple baseline models,
# while "custom" is for more advanced or tuned models.
# In Databricks, /Shared/ is the workspace folder visible to all users.
experiment_name_basic: /Shared/marvel-characters-basic
experiment_name_custom: /Shared/marvel-characters-custom

# ðŸ”¹ Model training hyperparameters
# These parameters control how the model is trained.
# You can tune them to optimize model performance.
parameters:
  learning_rate: 0.01
  n_estimators: 1000
  max_depth: 6

# ðŸ”¹ Numerical features
# Continuous variables that the model will treat as numeric inputs.
num_features:
- Height
- Weight

# ðŸ”¹ Categorical features
# Discrete variables that represent categories/groups.
# The model may need encoding (e.g., one-hot or embeddings).
cat_features:
- Universe
- Identity
- Gender
- Marital_Status
- Teams
- Origin
- Magic
- Mutant

# ðŸ”¹ Target variable
# This is the column the model will predict.
# In this case, whether the character is Alive or not.
target: Alive
